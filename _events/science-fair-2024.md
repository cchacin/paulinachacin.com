## Event Overview

The Regional Science Fair is an annual competition showcasing student research projects across all STEM disciplines. Over 150 students from 15 high schools presented original research to a panel of judges comprising university professors, industry scientists, and STEM professionals.

The fair provides students the opportunity to conduct authentic scientific research, develop presentation skills, and compete for recognition and advancement to the state-level competition.

## My Participation

I competed in the Biology category with my independent research project titled **"Biodiversity Assessment of Local Wetland Ecosystems: Impact of Urban Development on Species Richness and Composition."**

The project examined species diversity across three local wetlands with varying proximity to urban development to understand how urbanization affects ecosystem health and biodiversity.

## Project Details

### Research Question

**How does proximity to urban development affect biodiversity in local wetland ecosystems?**

I hypothesized that wetlands closer to urban areas would show reduced species diversity due to habitat fragmentation, pollution, and altered hydrology.

### Methodology

**Field Work** (8 weeks, February-March 2024):
- Selected 3 wetland sites: urban-adjacent (0.5 miles from development), suburban (2 miles), and rural (5+ miles)
- Conducted weekly species surveys at each site during same time periods
- Documented plant species using transect sampling methods
- Surveyed amphibian populations using visual encounter surveys and audio monitoring
- Recorded insect diversity using sweep netting and visual observation

**Data Analysis**:
- Identified and cataloged all species using field guides and dichotomous keys
- Calculated biodiversity indices (Shannon-Wiener, Simpson's) for each site
- Used statistical analysis (ANOVA) to compare species richness across sites
- Analyzed correlation between urban proximity and biodiversity metrics

**Sample Size**:
- 24 survey sessions (8 weeks × 3 sites)
- 147 total plant species identified
- 12 amphibian species documented
- Hundreds of insect specimens observed and categorized

### Key Findings

**Biodiversity Impact**:
- Urban-adjacent wetland showed **35% lower overall species diversity** compared to rural site
- Native plant species were particularly affected, with 42% fewer native species in urban wetland
- Amphibian populations showed **sharp decline** in urbanized wetland (only 4 species vs. 9 in rural site)

**Specific Observations**:
- Invasive plant species dominated urban wetland (62% coverage vs. 18% in rural wetland)
- Pollution-tolerant species (indicator species) prevalent in urban site
- Altered hydrology from nearby development affected seasonal water levels

**Statistical Significance**:
- ANOVA results showed statistically significant difference (p < 0.01) in species richness across sites
- Strong negative correlation (r = -0.82) between urban proximity and biodiversity index

### Presentation

I created a research poster following scientific poster guidelines and prepared a 10-minute oral presentation for the judging panel. The presentation included:

- Background on wetland ecology and importance of biodiversity
- Clear explanation of methodology and site selection rationale
- Visual data representations (charts, graphs, photos)
- Discussion of findings and implications for conservation
- Acknowledgment of limitations and suggestions for future research

**Judge Panel**: 5 judges including ecology professors from local universities and environmental scientists from conservation organizations

## Results & Recognition

### Awards
- **🏆 1st Place - Biology Category** (out of 25 biology projects)
- **Advancement to State Science Fair** (scheduled for May 2024)
- **Special Recognition for Environmental Research** from Regional Environmental Council

### Judge Feedback

Judges praised several aspects of the project:
- **Thorough methodology**: "Excellent use of established biodiversity assessment techniques"
- **Real-world application**: "Research has direct relevance to local conservation planning"
- **Clear presentation**: "Communicated complex ecological concepts effectively to varied audience"
- **Scientific rigor**: "Appropriate statistical analysis and acknowledgment of limitations"

One judge noted: "This research provides valuable baseline data for understanding urban impacts on local ecosystems and could inform conservation policy decisions."

## Impact & Significance

### Scientific Contribution

This research contributed to local conservation efforts in several ways:

1. **Data for Decision-Making**: I shared findings with the City Planning Commission, which is considering wetland protection ordinances
2. **Baseline Assessment**: Created first comprehensive biodiversity survey of these three wetlands
3. **Conservation Priority**: Data helped identify urban wetland as high-priority for restoration efforts

### Personal Impact

This project deepened my interest in environmental biology and showed me how scientific research can directly inform policy and conservation action. It also taught me:

- **Research Process**: From hypothesis formation through data collection to analysis and presentation
- **Scientific Communication**: How to translate complex findings for diverse audiences
- **Environmental Stewardship**: The importance of protecting local ecosystems from development pressures

## Skills Developed

`Scientific Research` `Data Analysis` `Field Biology` `Statistical Analysis` `Public Speaking` `Scientific Writing` `Critical Thinking` `Project Management` `Species Identification`

## Reflections

### Challenges Overcome

**Weather Variability**: Several weeks had heavy rain or extreme cold that made field surveys difficult. I adapted by adjusting survey times and ensuring consistent methodology across all conditions.

**Species Identification**: Identifying 147 plant species required extensive use of field guides, online resources, and consultation with a local botanist. This challenge taught me patience and attention to detail.

**Time Management**: Balancing weekly field surveys with schoolwork required careful planning and dedication to early morning survey sessions.

### Key Learnings

1. **Science is iterative**: My methodology evolved as I encountered challenges in the field, teaching me that research requires flexibility
2. **Communication matters**: Data is only valuable if communicated clearly—presentation skills are as important as research skills
3. **Real-world relevance motivates**: Knowing this research could influence conservation policy made the work more meaningful
4. **Patience is crucial**: Scientific research requires sustained effort over time, not just quick results

### Future Directions

This experience has shaped my academic and career interests:

- **College Major**: Confirmed my interest in studying environmental biology or ecology
- **Career Path**: Interested in research-based conservation work or environmental policy
- **Continued Research**: Hope to expand this project to survey more sites and track changes over multiple years
- **State Competition**: Preparing enhanced presentation for state science fair in May

I'm also working with my Environmental Club to organize wetland clean-up events at the urban site to contribute to restoration efforts beyond research.
