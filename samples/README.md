## üîÑ Replacing Samples with Real Content

When you're ready to add real content:

1. **Create actual collection directories** (if not already created):
```bash
mkdir -p _volunteering _events _activities _data
```

2. **Copy sample as starting point**:
```bash
cp samples/_volunteering/habitat-for-humanity.md _volunteering/my-real-activity.md
```

3. **Edit with real information**:
- Update all front matter fields
- Replace content with actual experiences
- Add real images (update image paths)
- Update tags to reflect reality

4. **Delete or update sample references**:
- Remove sample content from production
- Update `_config.yml` to exclude `samples/` from build
