## Overview

Habitat for Humanity builds affordable housing for families in need through volunteer labor and donated materials. After learning about the local housing crisis affecting low-income families in our community, I wanted to contribute my time and energy to help provide safe, stable homes for those who need them most.

Over five weekend build sessions from June through August 2024, I worked alongside experienced contractors, fellow volunteers, and the future homeowners to construct two complete homes from foundation to finish.

## My Role

**Primary Responsibilities**: Construction work including framing, insulation, and basic electrical installation under licensed contractor supervision

**Skills Applied**: Physical labor, tool operation, safety protocols, teamwork, and problem-solving

**Team Collaboration**: Led a crew of 5 volunteers during the framing phase, coordinating tasks and ensuring safety compliance while maintaining efficient workflow

### Specific Contributions

- Assisted with foundation preparation and floor joist installation
- Led framing crew of 5 volunteers in constructing wall frames for both homes
- Helped install insulation and vapor barriers throughout both structures
- Assisted licensed electrician with running electrical wire and installing outlet boxes
- Coordinated tool inventory and maintained safety equipment for volunteer crews
- Participated in final cleanup and landscaping to prepare homes for families

## Activities & Achievements

**Construction Milestones**:
- Contributed to building 2 complete homes for local families over 5 weekend sessions
- Completed 40+ total volunteer hours across construction phases
- Led framing crew during critical structural phase of both builds

**Leadership Accomplishments**:
- Coordinated workflow for 5-person volunteer crew during framing phase
- Trained 3 first-time volunteers on safety protocols and basic construction techniques
- Managed tool checkout and return system to maintain equipment accountability

**Skill Development**:
- Learned construction techniques from experienced contractors and licensed electricians
- Gained proficiency in using power tools including circular saws, drills, and nail guns
- Developed understanding of building codes and safety regulations
- Strengthened physical endurance and problem-solving abilities

## Impact

This volunteer work directly helped two families achieve safe, affordable housing—a fundamental need that many in our community struggle to access. Beyond the immediate impact of providing homes, this experience opened my eyes to the broader issue of housing insecurity and the power of community collaboration to address it.

For the families who received these homes, the impact is transformative: stable housing means children can stay in the same schools, parents have predictable housing costs, and families can build equity and financial stability.

For me personally, this experience deepened my commitment to addressing social inequities through direct, hands-on service. It also taught me that meaningful change often requires getting your hands dirty—literally.

## Reflections

Working with Habitat for Humanity taught me several important lessons:

**Service requires sacrifice**: Giving up comfortable weekend mornings for physical labor in the summer heat tested my commitment, but witnessing the impact made every early wake-up worthwhile.

**Collaboration multiplies impact**: No single volunteer could build a home alone, but together, our coordinated effort created something permanent and meaningful for families in need.

**Systemic problems need systemic solutions**: While building two homes helped two families, the experience motivated me to learn more about housing policy, affordable housing development, and the root causes of housing insecurity.

**Leadership means empowering others**: As crew leader, I learned that effective leadership isn't about doing everything yourself—it's about coordinating efforts, ensuring safety, and helping everyone contribute their best work.

This experience has shaped my interest in studying urban planning or public policy in college, with a focus on addressing housing affordability and community development challenges.

## Future Involvement

I plan to continue volunteering with Habitat for Humanity throughout my junior and senior years, with goals to:
- Complete at least 100 total volunteer hours by graduation
- Develop more advanced construction skills
- Potentially lead larger volunteer crews or help with recruitment efforts
- Explore Habitat's advocacy work around affordable housing policy
