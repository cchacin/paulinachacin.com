## 💡 Key Insights from Session

### What We Learned

**1. Hybrid Approach is Best**:

- Built-in features (theme switching) are time-savers

**2. Collections Are Critical**:
- College admissions expect clear categories
- Scalable as Paullina adds achievements
- Professional structure shows organization

**3. Single Source of Truth Matters**:
- Resume YAML feeds multiple pages
- Update once, reflects everywhere
- Prevents content drift/inconsistency

**4. Content Before Code**:
- Quality content takes time to gather
- Better to collect content first, then build
- Samples help visualize final product

**5. Accessibility is Non-Negotiable**:
- College websites must be accessible
