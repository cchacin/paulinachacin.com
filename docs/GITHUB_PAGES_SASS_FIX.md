# GitHub Pages Sass Compatibility Fix

## Issue
After deploying to GitHub Pages, the website displayed without any styling. Investigation revealed:
- CSS file was loading successfully (200 status)
- But the CSS content was just `@use "theme";` (raw SCSS)
- No compiled styles were being applied

## Root Cause
**GitHub Pages uses an older version of Sass that does not support the modern `@use` syntax.**

While the deprecation warning suggested updating to `@use`:
```
DEPRECATION WARNING [import]: Sass @import rules are deprecated
and will be removed in Dart Sass 3.0.0.
```

This advice applies to **local development** with newer Sass versions, but **GitHub Pages requires the legacy `@import` syntax** for compatibility.

## Solution
Reverted `assets/css/main.scss` from `@use` back to `@import`:

```scss
---
# Front matter required for Jekyll to process
---

@import "theme";  # ✅ GitHub Pages compatible
# @use "theme";   # ❌ Not supported by GitHub Pages Sass version
```

## Verification
1. **Local Build**: `bundle exec jekyll build` - succeeds with deprecation warning (expected)
2. **CSS Output**: `_site/assets/css/main.css` - contains full compiled CSS (8000+ bytes)
3. **Deployment**: Push to GitHub Pages and verify styles load correctly

## Trade-off
- ✅ **Production**: Site works on GitHub Pages with `@import`
- ⚠️ **Development**: Deprecation warning appears (can be ignored for GitHub Pages compatibility)

## Alternative Solutions
If you need to avoid deprecation warnings AND use modern Sass:

### Option 1: Self-Host (Not GitHub Pages)
Deploy to platforms with newer Sass versions:
- Netlify (supports `@use`)
- Vercel (supports `@use`)
- Cloudflare Pages (supports `@use`)

### Option 2: Pre-compile CSS Locally
1. Compile CSS locally with modern Sass
2. Commit compiled CSS to repo
3. Disable Jekyll Sass processing

### Option 3: Use GitHub Actions
Create a custom build workflow that:
1. Uses modern Sass to compile CSS
2. Commits compiled CSS
3. Deploys to GitHub Pages

## Recommendation
**For simplicity, use `@import` syntax.** The deprecation warning is harmless for GitHub Pages deployment, and the site will continue working until you're ready to migrate to a different hosting platform.
