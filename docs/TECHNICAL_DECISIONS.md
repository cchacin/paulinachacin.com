# Technical Decisions & Rationale

**Project**: Paullina Chacin Portfolio Website
**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Decision Session**: Initial brainstorming and architecture planning

---

## üéØ Decision Framework

All decisions were evaluated based on:
1. **College Application Alignment**: Does it serve the primary goal?
2. **Maintainability**: Can Paullina or her father easily update content?
3. **Professional Quality**: Does it meet academic/professional standards?
4. **Technical Simplicity**: Is it as simple as possible while meeting requirements?
5. **Scalability**: Can it grow with her throughout junior/senior year?

---

## Decision 1: Development Strategy

### Options Considered

**A. Custom Jekyll Build (From Scratch)**
- Full creative control
- Lightweight
- More development time

**B. Academic Theme Adaptation**
- Built-in features
- Faster deployment
- Less unique

**C. Hybrid Approach** ‚úÖ **SELECTED**
- Best of both worlds
- Leverage existing features
- Customize to requirements

### Rationale

**Why Hybrid (C)?**

‚úÖ **Time Efficiency**: Starting with a proven foundation (al-folio) saves weeks of development time while still allowing full customization

‚úÖ **Feature Leverage**: Gets built-in dark/light mode, JSON resume system, and responsive design immediately

‚úÖ **Learning Balance**: Provides structure to understand while allowing creativity in customization

‚úÖ **Quality Foundation**: Built on battle-tested code used by academics worldwide

‚ùå **Trade-off**: Need to understand and refactor existing code rather than building from scratch

### Impact

- Reduces initial development time by ~50%
- Ensures professional quality baseline
- Provides upgrade path as needs evolve

---

## Decision 2: Base Template Selection

### Options Considered

**A. al-folio** ‚úÖ **SELECTED**
- Modern, feature-rich
- Built-in light/dark mode
- JSON resume system

**B. Academic Pages**
- Simpler codebase
- Well-documented
- Need to build theme switcher

**C. Start Fresh + Cherry-pick**
- Maximum control
- Most manual work
- Cleanest architecture

### Rationale

**Why al-folio (A)?**

‚úÖ **Theme Switching**: Dark/light/auto mode is already implemented and tested - the hardest technical challenge is solved

‚úÖ **Resume System**: JSON-based resume generation aligns perfectly with "single source of truth" requirement

‚úÖ **Modern Codebase**: Clean, well-organized SCSS architecture makes Catppuccin theme integration straightforward

‚úÖ **Active Development**: Regular updates, security patches, and community support

‚úÖ **Proven at Scale**: Used by hundreds of academics, tested across browsers and devices

‚ùå **Trade-off**: More features to strip out than Academic Pages, but worth it for built-in theme system

### Technical Details

- **Theme Implementation**: Uses CSS custom properties and localStorage
- **Resume Format**: Supports both JSON and YAML (we'll adapt to YAML for easier editing)
- **Build System**: Standard Jekyll with minimal custom plugins
- **Dependencies**: Well-maintained, no deprecated packages

### Impact

- Saves 4-6 hours on theme switcher implementation
- Provides robust resume rendering system
- Ensures cross-browser compatibility from day one

---

## Decision 3: Content Architecture

### Options Considered

**A. Collection-Based Structure** ‚úÖ **SELECTED**
- Separate collections per content type
- Scalable and organized
- Professional structure

**B. Simple Pages Structure**
- Traditional approach
- Easier initial setup
- Harder to scale

**C. Hybrid: Pages + One Collection**
- Single "projects" collection
- Simpler than full collections
- Less clear categorization

### Rationale

**Why Collection-Based (A)?**

‚úÖ **College Application Alignment**: Admissions officers expect clear categories (Volunteering, Leadership, Activities)

‚úÖ **Scalability**: Easy to add new achievements throughout junior and senior year without restructuring

‚úÖ **Metadata Rich**: Each item can have dates, categories, tags, impact statements, images

‚úÖ **Automatic Organization**: Jekyll generates list pages and individual detail pages automatically

‚úÖ **Professionalism**: Shows technical sophistication and organizational thinking

‚ùå **Trade-off**: Slightly more complex initial setup than single pages

### Technical Implementation

```yaml
collections:
  volunteering:
    output: true
    permalink: /volunteering/:name/
    sort_by: date
  events:
    output: true
    permalink: /events/:name/
    sort_by: date
  activities:
    output: true
    permalink: /activities/:name/
    sort_by: date
```

### Front Matter Schema

```yaml
---
layout: collection-item
title: "Habitat for Humanity - House Build"
date: 2024-06-15
category: community-service
tags: [construction, teamwork, leadership]
image: /assets/images/habitat-2024.jpg
hours: 40
impact: "Helped build 2 homes for local families"
skills: [teamwork, physical-labor, project-management]
---
```

### Impact

- Clear organizational structure for college reviewers
- Easy content management (add markdown files to collection folders)
- Can filter/sort by date, category, or tags
- Reusable data structure across site

---

## Decision 4: Navigation & Layout Structure

### Options Considered

**A. Traditional Top Navigation**
- Classic header menu
- Professional
- Less modern

**B. Hero Home + Side Navigation**
- Modern, visual
- Great first impression
- May be too creative

**C. Hybrid: Clean Top Nav + Featured Home** ‚úÖ **SELECTED**
- Professional navigation
- Engaging homepage
- Balanced approach

**D. Academic Dashboard Style**
- Visual grid cards
- Modern
- Less traditional

### Rationale

**Why Hybrid (C)?**

‚úÖ **Accessibility**: Clear top navigation works for everyone (including screen readers, keyboard navigation)

‚úÖ **Familiarity**: College admissions officers can find what they need immediately

‚úÖ **Engagement**: Featured homepage highlights key accomplishments without forcing exploration

‚úÖ **Mobile Friendly**: Clean navigation collapses to hamburger menu, featured content stacks naturally

‚úÖ **Balance**: Modern enough to show tech-savvy, traditional enough to be professional

‚ùå **Trade-off**: Less visually bold than Option B or D, but appropriate for academic context

### Navigation Structure

```
Primary Nav (Desktop):
[Home] [About] [Volunteering] [Events] [Activities] [Resume] [Contact]

Mobile:
[‚ò∞] ‚Üí Slide-out menu with same links

Homepage Sections:
1. Hero: Photo + Name + Class of 2026
2. Introduction: Brief bio paragraph
3. Featured Highlights: 3-4 key accomplishments
4. Quick Links: Visual cards to main sections
5. Call-to-action: Download Resume
```

### Impact

- Easy navigation for all users
- Professional first impression
- Highlights best work prominently
- Mobile-responsive from the start

---

## Decision 5: Resume/CV Implementation Strategy

### Options Considered

**A. JSON Resume Standard + Custom Template**
- Industry standard
- al-folio supports it
- JSON editing tedious

**B. Markdown Resume + PDF Export**
- Easy editing
- Print CSS for PDF
- Manual PDF generation

**C. Hybrid: YAML Data + Multiple Views** ‚úÖ **SELECTED**
- YAML easier than JSON
- Single source of truth
- Web + print layouts

**D. Automated PDF Generation**
- GitHub Actions automation
- Always in sync
- Complex setup

### Rationale

**Why YAML + Multiple Views (C)?**

‚úÖ **Ease of Editing**: YAML is human-readable and easy to update (vs JSON's strict syntax)

‚úÖ **Single Source of Truth**: `_data/resume.yml` feeds both web view and print view

‚úÖ **Data Reuse**: Can pull volunteer/event/activity data from resume into collections (DRY principle)

‚úÖ **Print Optimization**: Dedicated print layout ensures perfect PDFs via browser print

‚úÖ **No Automation Complexity**: Simple enough to maintain without GitHub Actions, but upgradeable later

‚ùå **Trade-off**: Need to maintain two layouts (web + print), but both read same data source

### Data Structure Example

```yaml
# _data/resume.yml

- Clean typography for printing
- Single page or clean page breaks

### PDF Generation Workflow

1. User clicks "Download PDF" button on `/resume/`
2. Opens `/resume/print/` in new tab
3. User uses browser Print ‚Üí Save as PDF
4. Alternative: Instructions for generating PDF provided on page

### Impact

- Easy content updates (edit one YAML file)
- Professional web and PDF versions
- Consistent data across site
- No external dependencies
- Upgradeable to automation later if needed

## Design Decisions

### Catppuccin Color Scheme

**Latte (Light Mode)**
```scss
$latte-base: #eff1f5;
$latte-text: #4c4f69;
$latte-subtext0: #6c6f85;
$latte-overlay0: #9ca0b0;
$latte-surface0: #ccd0da;
$latte-blue: #1e66f5;    // Primary accent
$latte-green: #40a02b;   // Success
$latte-red: #d20f39;     // Error/warning
```

**Macchiato (Dark Mode)**
```scss
$macchiato-base: #24273a;
$macchiato-text: #cad3f5;
$macchiato-subtext0: #a5adcb;
$macchiato-overlay0: #6e738d;
$macchiato-surface0: #363a4f;
$macchiato-blue: #8aadf4;    // Primary accent
$macchiato-green: #a6da95;   // Success
$macchiato-red: #ed8796;     // Error/warning
```
