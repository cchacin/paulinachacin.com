# Link Fixes Summary

All broken and missing links have been identified and fixed.

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. âœ… Missing Environmental Club Page
- **Issue**: Resume referenced `/activities/environmental-club/` but page didn't exist
- **Fix**: Created `_activities/environmental-club.md` with complete content
- **Created**: Placeholder image `environmental-club.svg` (800Ã—600px)
